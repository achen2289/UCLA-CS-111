Included files
- This overall project contains the code for a multi-process telnet-like client and server
- lab1b-client.c contains my code for the client, which communicates with the server
- lab1b-server.c contains my code for the server, which forks a child process
- Makefile contains the default, clean, and dist targets
- The Makefile compiles the two c files with the -Wall and -Wextra options
- It does not contain the check target

Testing
- I have run my program with the sanity script, and it has passed all tests.
- I had extraodinary difficulty debugging my frozen server terminal, and with
- the help of consulting Piazza and stackoverflow, I solved it by 
- buffering the compression of data from shell!
