Included files:
- lab4c_tcp.c, lab4c_tls.c
    - C source files for two embedded applications that build and run on a Beaglebone.
- Makefile
    default ... build both versions of your program (compiling with the -Wall and -Wextra options).
    clean ... delete all programs and output created by the Makefile and restore the directory to its freshly untarred state.
    dist ... create the deliverable tarball.
    Note that this Makefile is intended to be executed on a Beaglebone, but you may find it convenient to create a Makefile that can be run on either a Beaglebone or a Linux server/desktop/notebook.
- README
    - containing descriptions of each of the included files.
    - any other comments on your submission that you would like to bring to our attention (e.g., research, limitations, features, testing methodology).
